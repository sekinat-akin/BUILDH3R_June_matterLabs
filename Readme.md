# Build smart contract

This learning process established a strong foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. Practical tasks and progress documentation on GitHub provided hands-on experience and resulted in a demonstrative portfolio. I learned to create ERC20 tokens, manage hashed messages on the blockchain, and automate contract interactions using ethers.js. Furthermore, I explored the use of zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee management and token balance oversight.
